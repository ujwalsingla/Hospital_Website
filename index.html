The front office staff at the reception will assist you during the admission process. They will generate a Unique Identification Number (UID) for the patient and all the medical records will be maintained and stored by the hospital for all future reference. They will also draw out an estimate and guide you for selecting the relevant category of room.

In addition, you will be required to make an advance payment. The advance shall be adjusted against the final bill at the time of discharge. Those seeking the cashless route would have to visit the insurance desk / TPA desk for the hospitalisation of the patient. The staff will escort the patient to the allotted room/bed and make you feel comfortable.. <br><br>
<h3>GUIDELINES</h3>
<ul>
<li> For the comfort of all our patients, we request you to limit your visitors during visiting hours
<li>Please note that visitors may be restricted according to a patient’s medical condition and/or special needs.
<li>At the time of admission, you will be issued passes for attendants and visitors. Please request your attendant and visitors to wear/display these passes while in the hospital premises. In case of loss of the pass, you may get in touch with the Concierge Desk located in the hospital main entrance. 
<li>Sanitise hands before and after visiting.
<li> Visits by children under the age of 12 are not allowed on patient floors. This is to protect children from catching any infection.
